TCS NQT Coding Question 2022 
Problem Statement –
A chocolate factory is packing chocolates into the packets. The chocolate packets here represent an array  of N number of integer values. The task is to find the empty packets(0) of chocolate and push it to the end of the conveyor belt(array).
Example 1 :
N=8 and arr = [4,5,0,1,9,0,5,0].
There are 3 empty packets in the given set. These 3 empty packets represented as O should be pushed towards the end of the array
Input :
8  – Value of N
[4,5,0,1,9,0,5,0] – Element of arr[O] to arr[N-1],While input each element is separated by newline
Output:
4 5 1 9 5 0 0 0

Example 2:
Input:
6 — Value of N.
[6,0,1,8,0,2] – Element of arr[0] to arr[N-1], While input each element is separated by newline
Output:
6 1 8 2 0 0






TCS NQT Coding Question 2022 
Problem Statement –
Joseph is learning digital logic subject which will be for his next semester. He usually tries to solve unit assignment problems before the lecture. Today he got one tricky question. The problem statement is “A positive integer has been given as an input. Convert decimal value to binary representation. Toggle all bits of it after the most significant bit including the most significant bit. Print the positive integer value after toggling all bits”.
Constrains-
1<=N<=100
Example 1:
Input :
10  -> Integer
Output :
5    -> result- Integer
Explanation:
Binary representation of 10 is 1010. After toggling the bits(1010), will get 0101 which represents “5”. Hence output will print “5”.

TCS NQT Coding Question 
Problem Statement – Given a string S(input consisting) of ‘*’ and ‘#’. The length of the string is variable. The task is to find the minimum number of ‘*’ or ‘#’ to make it a valid string. The string is considered valid if the number of ‘*’ and ‘#’ are equal. The ‘*’ and ‘#’ can be at any position in the string.
Note : The output will be a positive or negative integer based on number of ‘*’ and ‘#’ in the input string.
•	(*>#): positive integer
•	(#>*): negative integer
•	(#=*): 0
Example 1:
Input 1:
•	###***   -> Value of S
Output :
•	0   → number of * and # are equal




TCS Coding Question 
Given an integer array Arr of size N the task is to find the count of elements whose value is greater than all of its prior elements.
Note : 1st element of the array should be considered in the count of the result.
For example,
Arr[]={7,4,8,2,9}
As 7 is the first element, it will consider in the result.
8 and 9 are also the elements that are greater than all of its previous elements.
Since total of  3 elements is present in the array that meets the condition.
Hence the output = 3.
Example 1:
Input 
5 -> Value of N, represents size of Arr
7-> Value of Arr[0]
4 -> Value of Arr[1]
8-> Value of Arr[2]
2-> Value of Arr[3]
9-> Value of Arr[4]
Output :
3
Example 2:
5   -> Value of N, represents size of Arr
3  -> Value of Arr[0]
4 -> Value of Arr[1]
5 -> Value of Arr[2]
8 -> Value of Arr[3]
9 -> Value of Arr[4]
Output : 
5
Constraints
•	1<=N<=20
•	1<=Arr[i]<=10000







TCS Coding Question Day 1 Slot 2 – Question 2
A parking lot in a mall has RxC number of parking spaces. Each parking space will either be  empty(0) or full(1). The status (0/1) of a parking space is represented as the element of the matrix. The task is to find index of the prpeinzta row(R) in the parking lot that has the most of the parking spaces full(1).
Note :
RxC- Size of the matrix
Elements of the matrix M should be only 0 or 1.
Example 1:
Input :
3   -> Value of R(row)
3    -> value of C(column)
[0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1] -> Elements of the array M[R][C] where each element is separated by new line.
Output :
3  -> Row 3 has maximum number of 1’s
Example 2:
input :
4 -> Value of R(row)
3 -> Value of C(column)
[0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1] -> Elements of the array M[R][C]
Output :
4  -> Row 4 has maximum number of 1’s




TCS Coding Question Day 2 Slot 1 – Question 1
A party has been organised on cruise. The party is organised for a limited time(T). The number of guests entering (E[i]) and leaving (L[i]) the party at every hour is represented as elements of the array. The task is to find the maximum number of guests present on the cruise at any given instance within T hours.
Example 1:
Input :
•	5    -> Value of T
•	[7,0,5,1,3]  -> E[], Element of E[0] to E[N-1], where input each element is separated by new line 
•	[1,2,1,3,4]   -> L[], Element of L[0] to L[N-1], while input each element is separate by new line.
Output :
8     -> Maximum number of guests on cruise at an instance.
Explanation:
1st hour:
Entry : 7 Exit: 1
No. of guests on ship : 6
2nd hour :
Entry : 0 Exit : 2
No. of guests on ship : 6-2=4
Hour 3:
Entry: 5 Exit: 1
No. of guests on ship : 4+5-1=8
Hour 4:
Entry : 1 Exit : 3
No. of guests on ship : 8+1-3=6
Hour 5:
Entry : 3 Exit: 4
No. of guests on ship: 6+3-4=5
Hence, the maximum number of guests within 5 hours is 8.
Example 2:
Input:
4  -> Value of T
[3,5,2,0]   -> E[], Element of E[0] to E[N-1], where input each element is separated by new line.
[0,2,4,4]    -> L[], Element of L[0] to L[N-1], while input each element in separated by new line
Output:
6
Cruise at an instance
Explanation:
Hour 1:
Entry: 3 Exit: 0
No. of guests on ship: 3
Hour 2:
Entry : 5 Exit : 2
No. of guest on ship: 3+5-2=6
Hour 3:
Entry : 2 Exit: 4
No. of guests on ship: 6+2-4= 4
Hour 4:
Entry: 0  Exit : 4
No. of guests on ship : 4+0-4=0
Hence, the maximum number of guests within 5 hours is 6.

Question 
 
At the security checkpoint, airport security personnel have seized a number of travellers’ belongings. Everything has been thrown into a big box (array). Each product carries a specific level of risk[0,1,2]. The risk severity of the items in this case is represented by an array[] of N integer values. Sorting the elements in the array according to the degrees of danger is the task at hand. Between 0 and 2 are the risk values.
Example :
Input :
7  -> Value of N
[1,0,2,0,1,0,2]-> Element of arr[0] to arr[N-1], while input each element is separated by new line.
Output :
0 0 0 1 1 2 2  -> Element after sorting based on risk severity
Example 2:
input : 10  -> Value of N
[2,1,0,2,1,0,0,1,2,0] -> Element of arr[0] to arr[N-1], while input each element is separated by a new line.
Output : 
0 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 2 2  ->Elements after sorting based on risk severity.
Explanation:
In the above example, the input is an array of size N consisting of only 0’s, 1’s and 2s. The output is a sorted array from 0 to 2 based on risk severity.


Question 8
For all of its products, a supermarket maintains a pricing structure. Each product has a value N printed on it. The price of the item is determined by multiplying the value N, which is read by the scanner, by the sum of all its digits. The goal here is to create software that, given the code of any item N, will compute the product (multiplication) of all the value digits (price).
Example 1:
Input :
5244 -> Value of N
Output :
160 -> Price 
Explanation:
From the input above 
Product of the digits 5,2,4,4
5*2*4*4= 160
Hence, output is 160.
